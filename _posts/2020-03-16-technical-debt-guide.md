title: Technical Debt Guide
---

A recurring theme throughout my career has been developers asking the question "why don't we get more time to fix technical debt?"

This was the inspiration behind a talk I gave a few times last year, called [Why Not Fix Your Technical Debt?](/talks/why-not-fix-your-technical-debt)

I've turned some previous talks I've given into blog posts, and started doing the same with this. I wanted to add a bit more detail, including a nice case study of some technical debt I came across (and fixed!) during my time at Stack Overflow. Doing that made it far too big to be just one blog post, so I've created a whole website instead.

Presenting: **[Technical Debt - a guide for developers and product managers](https://techdebtguide.com)**.
