A year ago, I released my first work of interactive fiction "<a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/zbzfpcnknu_vdjog-cbihw/moquette">Moquette</a>" into the <a href="http://www.ifcomp.org/comp/2013">IFComp</a>.

Today, I'm releasing the source code for it: <a href="https://github.com/alexwarren/moquette">https://github.com/alexwarren/moquette</a>

It might be useful if you're interested in implementing similar text effects in your own Quest game - if so, <a title="Building Moquette – Simulating the London Underground and Doing Pretty Things With Text" href="/2013/11/26/building-moquette-simulating-the-london-underground-and-doing-pretty-things-with-text/">this blog post</a> may also help.

Or who knows, maybe you'd like to adapt it - fix up the writing, change the ending, whatever... you can now fork it and do what you like with it.

The commit history goes all the way back to when it was a very primitive London Underground simulator, so you can see how it evolved over time. You can see the bursts of activity on GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/alexwarren/moquette/graphs/contributors">commit graphs</a>, which give some indication of the ebbs and flows of my energy for writing.

I haven't had so much energy for writing for the last year, though I'm kicking around ideas again. Who knows where they will end up. Perhaps we haven't yet heard the last of Private Rod...
