    Most unpopular office sweets ever

When I was in Hong Kong I went to a shop called <a href="http://www.ajiichiban.com.hk/eng/index.php" target="_blank">Aji Ichiban</a> to pick up some sweets for the office.

I really wanted to pick up some <a href="/2009/10/03/hong-kong-day-3-bone-crunchin-good">duck kidneys</a> but UK customs forbid importing meat from outside the EU. So, I had to make do with some other weird-looking "treats", and they turned out to be almost as off-putting.

Usually whenever an email goes out about free food, there is a stampede and very quickly nothing is left. You'd think my colleagues never got fed. This time though, a few hovered around my desk, poking the sweets curiously and only a brave few were tempted to try one, with some trepidation.

It turns out that these sweets are more bizarre and disgusting than most of the food I tried while I was in Hong Kong. "Highlights" of my particular bag of delights were:
<ul>
	<li>Liquorice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausena_lansium" target="_blank">Wampee</a> – this didn't taste at all of liquorice. You know when you're visiting a stately home and there's that kind of musty, old-fashioned smell? These sweets taste like that. It's like eating Henry VIII’s duvet.</li>
	<li>Ginseng Candy – “like sucking on an incense stick”, said one of my colleagues. I think it was more like licking a school hall floor - kind of woody.</li>
	<li>Honey Plum – “sweets aren’t supposed to be salty are they?” said a co-worker, before spitting out the enormous seed into a nearby bin.</li>
	<li>A salty plum stone in a bland boiled sweet which looked like an eyeball – “the worst thing I’ve ever tasted” was one comment, which wasn't far off the mark. Bizarre and disgusting.</li>
	<li>Lemon tea – this was actually quite pleasant. It was odd to have a sweet that tasted of tea, but it did a great job of refreshing the palate after eating one of the other ones.</li>
	<li>Preserved strawberries – these were OK. They were just dried-out strawberries, so no unpleasant surprises there.</li>
	<li>Preserved spiced olive – this sounded like it would be hideous, but it was surprisingly nice - not much of an olive flavour thankfully, just an interestingly tasty mix of sweetness and spice with a hint of savoury.</li>
	<li>Hawthorne Cake – a sugary wafer, not too bad.</li>
	<li>Iced hawthorne – just like a sheet of fruit gum.</li>
</ul>
There were some great grimaces as people munched on what has to be the most unpopular office treat we've seen for some time. Mission accomplished!

Here are the leftovers...
