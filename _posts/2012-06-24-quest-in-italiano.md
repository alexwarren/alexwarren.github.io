Thanks to Francesco Cordella and Luca Salvicchi, you can now create Quest games in <strong>Italian</strong>.

This is now live on the <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/create/">web version of Quest</a>, and will be added to the next release of the desktop version.

This brings the total number of supported languages to seven:
<ul>
	<li>English</li>
	<li>French</li>
	<li>German</li>
	<li>Spanish</li>
	<li>Dutch</li>
	<li>Italian</li>
	<li>Esperanto</li>
</ul>
It is great to see Quest making non-English text adventures possible - and it's nice to see the first non-English games being published on the site. Recent additions include:
<ul>
	<li>Spanish game <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/review/567/">El secreto de las tres fuentes</a></li>
	<li>German game <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/review/494/">Bumerang Jack und das Amulett des Lebens - Teil 1 - Die Flucht</a></li>
</ul>
I look forward to seeing even more - as well as bringing text adventures to audiences who may not speak English, I believe this kind of game could be a great resource for teaching foreign languages too.

It would be wonderful to have even more translations - Welsh, Russian, Chinese would be very interesting additions. How do you create a translation? It's as simple as editing a text file. The page <a href="http://quest5.net/wiki/Translating_Quest">Translating Quest</a> on the wiki has details, and I'm happy to help with any questions you may have.

Arrivederci...
