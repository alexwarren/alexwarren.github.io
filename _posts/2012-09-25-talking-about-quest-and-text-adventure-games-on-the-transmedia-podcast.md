I am the guest on <a href="http://www.tstoryteller.com/transmedia-podcast-episode-six-adventure-games">episode six of Robert Pratten's Transmedia Podcast</a>. We had a good chat about the past, present and future of text adventure games, building interactive stories, expanding the "niche" for text based games, getting kids into game making and more.

It was great fun, though I inexplicably got the name of the first ever text adventure game wrong. So if you can forgive me for that, and the number of times I say "erm", you should hopefully enjoy the podcast!
