    Six Months Off

I'm now officially on a six-month sabbatical, during which I'm going to try and grow my software business, <a href="http://www.axeuk.com/">Axe Software</a>. I also think it would be interesting to take up blogging properly so I'll be talking about my progress, maybe a bit on this blog but more officially on the <a href="http://www.axeuk.com/blog">Axe Software blog</a> which I've just set up.

If it works out I'll be able to follow the dream of being my own boss, keeping my own hours and doing exactly what I want to do. I'll be able to pour more time into my other interests, writing comedy and music (for which I've just set up <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theembryomusic">a MySpace page</a>, thereby missing the bandwagon by perhaps 12 months).

If it doesn't work out, I'll end up in quite a lot of debt, but at least I can go back to a normal day job and hopefully have an increased level of sales over the following months and years, which <em>should</em> repay it.

And if it doesn't? Well, I won't know unless I have a go. And it's got to be more fun than working for somebody else for six months.
