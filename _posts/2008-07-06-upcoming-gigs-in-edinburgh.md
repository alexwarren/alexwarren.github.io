I'll be up at this year's Edinburgh festival, mostly just enjoying other acts to be honest, but I'll also be performing every night 9th-16th August, 5.45pm-6.45pm as one of four stand-up acts in a <strong>free</strong> show called <strong>Of Mics and Men</strong>.

It's at The Voodoo Bar in Haymarket - <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=EH3+8DU">click here for a map</a>.
