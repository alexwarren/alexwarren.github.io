It's the beginning of a new decade, so it's time to sort yourself out. Do you want to be the same old grumpy, boring, fat and stupid you of the noughties? Of course not! So turn your life around, try something new and rid yourself of ugliness using my fantastic guide to a whole new you, for a whole new decade!

<strong>Step 1: A Positive Outlook</strong>

Yes, maybe you think January is actually a rubbish time to stop your life from being crap. It's dark and cold, and the memories of a loving, laughter-filled and delicious Christmas are fading, to be replaced by the cold reality of your fat, grey reflection staring back at you in the bathroom mirror.

That's why it's time to Think Positive! Yes, you really can ignore reality if you just delude yourself enough! Turn that frown upside down! Those tears are tears of joy! You're not fat, just cuddly! You're not ugly, you just have an interesting face! You're not sad and alone in a big scary world full of people you wish would die - you're just independent!

At the end of every day, try to think of three good things that have happened to you that day. For example, although today has been a fairly average day for me, I can easily think of three good things about it:
<ul>
	<li>Today I wasn't brutally murdered by an escaped maniac!</li>
	<li>I managed to eat all my breakfast without spilling any down myself! Shame about the cup of tea I had afterwards though.</li>
	<li>I got a letter! That shows there's someone out there who cares! Even though it was an unscrupulous debt collection agency. Still, as they said themselves, it would be a real shame if something bad happened to my house - they're such caring souls!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 2: Rebrand Yourself</strong>

So now you're positive on the inside - it's time to get positive on the outside too. Cast off your old name and go forth into the brave new world with a moniker that tells everybody who you are, and why you're so great!

I hired a cutting-edge but cheap advertising agency to come up with a new brand. After several minutes of blue-sky thinking and meticulous market research, I now have a new identity to present to the world. Say goodbye to plain old "Alex Warren", say hello to "Alexwar<sup>®</sup> sponsored by Anusol".

<strong>Step 3: Change Your Look</strong>

Hey, you with the stupid noughties face! Announce your new life to the world with a fresh new look...

<strong>Step 4: Give Up Alcohol</strong>

You might think that the best way to while away the bleak winter months would be to drink so heavily that you spend much of this early part of the year completely unconscious, and the rest of it utterly oblivious to the misery that surrounds you. Not so! We're thinking positive, remember? You don't need alcohol to lull you into your new happy-go-lucky way of life, you just need a mantra.

So, next time you find yourself reaching for that bottle of vodka, just sit down and repeat to yourself, "I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm so very happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, so very happy, happy, happy, everything is fine, everything is fine, everything is fine, everything is fine, everything is fine, I'm happy, I'm not crying, I will be OK, I'm fine, everything is fine, everything is fine" while rocking gently back and forth.

<strong>Step 5: A New Career</strong>

After following the above steps, you'll probably turn up to work and realise that it just isn't fulfilling you any more. And, by complete coincidence, you may find that your current place of employment are more than willing to let you seek out a new life elsewhere. They'll be simply begging you to leave!

Perhaps you'll find the job of dreams out there. Maybe you'll decide that 2010 is the year for nothing but quiet contemplation, perhaps alone in a bedsit or some kind of hospital?

<strong>Step 6: Save Money</strong>

With your new direction, you'll have a lot less money coming in, and you won't be able to rely on your old friends to support you, because they will have stopped speaking to you. But they were useless anyway! They were holding you back, and you don't want to return to your old ways now - you've come too far. Just think positive.
<ul>
	<li>Save on transport costs by walking everywhere, or just going nowhere!</li>
	<li>Eat less! You'll save money, and not be quite so hideously fat!</li>
	<li>Stop washing your clothes! You may stink, but nobody will complain since nobody talks to you any more anyway! And we all like a bit of peace and quiet - so there's a bonus!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 7: Your New Life Awaits</strong>

If you've followed this guide, you'll have transformed from a sad, unloved, repugnant waste of space into a much happier one.

May all your dreams come true in 2010 (except those induced by heavy medication).
