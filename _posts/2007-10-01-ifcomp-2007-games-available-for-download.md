The 2007 Interactive Fiction competition (IFComp) has begun, and the 29 games are <a href="http://www.ifcomp.org">available for download</a>.

There is one Quest entry this year, though I do recommend you check out all of the games as they'll give you a good idea of the kinds of things people are doing via the medium of text adventure games.
