I am going to be performing some stand-up comedy this week, next week and the week after. I am trying not to shit myself too much...

<strong>Thursday 29th November: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monkeybusinesscomedyclub.co.uk/">Monkey Business</a></strong>
Upstairs at O'Reilly's, 289-291 Kentish Town Road NW5 2JS
Doors open 8pm. Nearest tube is Kentish Town. No idea how much the tickets are but they're probably not very much. You'll get to see quite a lot of acts for your money anyway.
