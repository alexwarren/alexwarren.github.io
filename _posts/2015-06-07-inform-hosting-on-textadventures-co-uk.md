You can now upload games created with <a href="http://inform7.com/">Inform</a> directly to textadventures.co.uk.

Previously, you could upload an HTML game created using Inform's "Release along with an interpreter" option, but now it's even easier - you can now upload aÂ .z5, .z8, .ulx, .zblorb or .gblorb file directly.

Just head to the "<a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/submit/submitfile">Submit a Game</a>" link and submit your file. After uploading the file, enter a few basic details and hit Publish. That's it! Your game's listing page is created, where it can be played online (using <a href="https://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment">Parchment</a>) or downloaded.

When publishing a game, you can also choose to keep your game unlisted, which means only people you give the link to will have access.

If you upload a blorb file that includes cover art, that will be automatically added to your game listing.
