Quest 4.1.2 is now available.

This release improves the performance of large games.

It also fixes the following bugs:
<ul>
	<li>A run-time error could occur when typing "put on" if that command did not exist.</li>
	<li>Locked exits weren't working in packaged games.</li>
	<li>Some container-related messages were not present in the LDF file.</li>
</ul>
If the JAWS screen-reader is running, QDK now shows the old-style menus and toolbars as these are easier for the screen-reader to work with. In addition there is a new "Go To" menu for JAWS users which makes it easier to select items from the Treeview.
