Just a quick note to say I'll be running Quest workshops at theÂ <a href="http://southwestlearningtechnologiesconference.co.uk/">South West Learning Technologies Conference</a> in Exeter on Thursday 4th October.

I'll be giving an introduction to Quest and with Kristian Still we'll be discussing the various uses of interactive fiction within the classroom. Hope to see you there!
