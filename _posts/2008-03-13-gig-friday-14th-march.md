Bit late notice (only confirmed this morning) and a bit far away, but my next gig is tomorrow at The Adelaide Pub, Teddington, TW11 0AU at 8pm. It's two minutes away from Teddington Station (exit at the ticket office side).

I've got some more gigs coming up in April, and I'll post the details here soon.
