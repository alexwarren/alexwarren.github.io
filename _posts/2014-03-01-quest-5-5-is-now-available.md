Changes since the beta:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Mauricio Díaz García</strong> updated the Spanish translation, and added a new editor translation - so the editor now is <em>mostly</em> displayed in Spanish when editing a Spanish game.</li>
	<li><strong>Pertex</strong> fixed a few bugs and did some more work on allowing the Editor to be translated.</li>
</ul>
Thanks once again to everybody who has contributed to this release: Pertex, Jay Nabonne, The Pixie, Guillaume Poulain, Katzy and Mauricio Díaz García, and also to Phillip Zolla for sponsoring the new drawing features in this release.
