What is technical debt and why is it important? When should we fix it, and when is it not worth fixing? When it comes to a choice between "fixing up old code" or "delivering new features", it's often "fixing up old code" which loses - how can we fight back against that?

Based on my experiences over the last 10 years, I'll talk about empowering developers to improve code while still delivering value to the business, and how the business can understand the benefits of fixing technical debt. We'll also look at when it might actually be better to leave the technical debt unfixed.

This talk was given at the Front End London meetup on 30th May 2019.
