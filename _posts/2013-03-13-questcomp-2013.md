<strong>Update 18th March - now with prize money!</strong>

It's officially the first unofficial Quest competition!

Over <a href="http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=3506">on the forums</a>, various people have got together to organise <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/competition/">QuestComp 2013</a> - a competition to use Quest to create a text adventure game around the theme of "Plague".

Evan Williams a.k.a TriangleGames is organising the competition, and <del>there are no prizes except for the glory of winning</del> thanks to Phillip Zolla for sponsoring a first prize of <strong>£100</strong>.

If you intend to enter, please email Evan by March 31st - full details on the rules, competition timetable and how to enter are at the <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/competition/">QuestComp 2013</a> page.

Thanks also to Scott Greig for the interesting logo, which I hope I've got the right way up.
