I'll be at <a href="http://screen7.co.uk/adventurex/">AdventureX 2012</a> in London on the weekend of 15-16 December - a free event for everybody interested in adventure games and game design.

The full schedule will be released at the beginning of December. I'm going to be doing a talk on the Sunday - probably a demo of <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/">Quest</a>, and maybe some thoughts on the future of text-based games. There will also be talks from Jon Ingold, Dave Gilbert, Stephen Marley, Götz Heinrich and more to be announced.

It's free to attend and you don't need a ticket - just turn up! Hope to see you there.
