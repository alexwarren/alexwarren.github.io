Quest 4.02 is now available.

If you've already got Quest or Quest Pro, the easiest way to update is by selecting "Check for updates" from the "Help" menu in Quest or QDK. If you're not already a user, you can download Quest from <a href="http://www.axeuk.com/quest/">http://www.axeuk.com/quest/</a>

This release fixes a few minor bugs in QuestÂ and QDK, including a few issues with Windows Vista.
