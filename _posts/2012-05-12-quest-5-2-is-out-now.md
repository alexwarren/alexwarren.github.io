Quest 5.2 has now been released, and you can grab it from the <a title="Download Quest" href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/">download page</a> or <a title="Create a text adventure game" href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/create/">use it online</a>.

For full details of what's new in this version, see the <a title="Quest 5.2 Beta is now available" href="/2012/04/14/quest-5-2-beta-is-now-available/">Quest 5.2 Beta announcement</a>. The only things changed since the beta are:
<ul>
	<li>a few bug fixes</li>
	<li>exit links now immediately move the player (unless they have more than one verb) - thanks to James Gregory for suggesting and implementing this</li>
	<li>the Editor will now not save invalid expressions (with mismatching brackets or quotes) to prevent a problem where this would cause the game file to become unloadable</li>
</ul>
