The first bug-fix release of Quest 5 is now available - <a title="Download Quest" href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/">download Quest 5.0.1 here</a>.

I'm pretty pleased that nothing <em>too</em> major was discovered in the v5.0 release, so thanks once again to the beta testers!

Here's what's new and what's fixed:
<ul>
	<li><strong>New feature:</strong> Players can now customise fonts and colours for a game from the new Options window.</li>
	<li><strong>New feature:</strong> Container "open" and "close" messages can be customised per container.</li>
	<li><strong>Improved:</strong> More useful error messages if Quest can't load a game file due to an error in one of your scripts.</li>
	<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Various issues with Quest 4 games - locked exits in CAS files, sounds in ZIP files, and timers running at the wrong time.</li>
	<li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Memory leaks in the Editor which could cause Quest to hang when switching to/from the Code View with large games.</li>
</ul>
