I am currently developing an extension of the Quest Games Archive that will let you play Quest games within your web browser - no additional software required.

To give this a go, please go to <a href="http://www.axeuk.com/cgi-bin/gamesonline.cgi">http://www.axeuk.com/cgi-bin/gamesonline.cgi</a> and just click on any game link to begin playing.

All you need is a browser that supports JavaScript and Flash.

So far I have tested this with Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2.

Please post any comments <a href="http://www.axeuk.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1595">to the forums</a>, or drop me an email at <a href="mailto:alex@axeuk.com">alex@axeuk.com</a>.

Note that as this is a beta, the facility may go down from time to time - but if you do notice any problems please let me know.
