Quest 4.1.5 is now available.

This is a small bug-fix and performance release:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:19px;">Loading QSG (save game) files is now faster.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height:19px;">Fixed a QDK bug with the "create corresponding exit" checkbox, which would become re-checked if it was turned off.</span></li>
</ul>
