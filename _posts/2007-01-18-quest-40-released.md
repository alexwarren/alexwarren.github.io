Quest 4.0 has finally been released, after a few months of beta testing.

QDK, the visual Quest editor, features a completely redesigned interface - it's now easier and faster to edit your games, and the editing is handled within one main screen, so you'll see less pop-up windows. Much of the internal code has been rewritten too, making QDK much more robust and reliable.

New features in Quest:
<ul>
	<li>containers</li>
	<li>verbs make it easier to set up custom commands</li>
	<li>you can now embed pictures, sounds etc. within your game file (using Quest Compiler)</li>
	<li>you can use more complex mathematical expressions within statements</li>
	<li>numeric variables are no longer forced to be integers, so you can use decimals and much larger numbers</li>
	<li>new Object Debugger gives you more power when debugging your game - when you're developing your game, you can change object properties and "jump" around it while it is in progress</li>
	<li>"select case" (switch) support</li>
	<li>MP3 support</li>
	<li>pictures are now displayed within the main text window</li>
</ul>
