I've uploaded some new music to my "The Embryo" MySpace page: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theembryomusic">http://www.myspace.com/theembryomusic</a>

The four new tracks are called <em>Come On You Bastard</em>, <em>Alarm</em>, <em>Waking Giant</em> and <em>Trump</em>.

They're all fairly short. I'm always impressed with myself when I manage to write a track that's over six minutes long, but most of my newer tracks don't even hit three minutes.

Either I'm running out of musical ideas or I'm becoming less self-indulgent.
