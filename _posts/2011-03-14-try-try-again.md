Is this becoming a habit? My <a title="My greatest weakness" href="/2010/07/01/my-greatest-weakness">greatest weakness</a>, boredom, has reared its head rather rapidly again, and I've found myself working through a notice period for the second time in less than twelve months.

How did I manage to find myself in the same situation again? I left my previous employer at the end of July last year, and wrote at the time that I wanted to mix things up a bit, alternating between contracting and working on my own software business.

Well, now I'm going to have a second try at making that plan work. I'm not going to rush into job hunting like I did last time - in fact, I'm not even going to look for a job at all for a while. I want to devote my time to my own business, <a href="http://www.axeuk.com">Axe Software</a>, and see where it takes me.

The seemingly insane thing about my plan is that Axe Software is currently making <em>much less</em> money than ever - I've recently stopped charging for my text adventure game engine, <a href="http://www.axeuk.com/quest/">Quest</a>, and I'm working on the new version 5.0 as free open-source software.

That sounds mad - "giving up your job to work on software that you're just going to give away? What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm OUT!" Well, I think it makes much more sense in the long term. Read my <a href="/2010/10/18/quest-5-0-is-now-open-source">blog post on making the switch to open source</a> for full details, but basically the software <em>has</em> to be free to compete with the other systems that are out there - not only are pretty much all of Quest's competitors free, but historically they've been more powerful too.

By making Quest both free (done) and totally kick-ass (to do), I'm hoping to make it appeal to many more users. So, perhaps this means in future there may be more opportunities for me to do paid-for customisations, for example. Perhaps there are ways of making money from other services that fit around Quest. Whatever, it doesn't actually matter - even if I never make a penny from it directly, I think it will be a great demonstration of the kind of work that I do - something that will make me stand out in the next round of job applications. Having all the code easily <a href="http://quest.codeplex.com/SourceControl/BrowseLatest">viewable on CodePlex</a> means future employers will have the ability to examine my work in considerable detail - every aspect of a large software project that I have designed, architected, coded, delivered, and is actually <em>enjoyed</em> by people who <em>choose</em> to use it. If an employer is not interested in that, it's unlikely I'm interested in working for them.

But most importantly, <em>it's what I want to do</em>. I really want to build this software, and I have the opportunity - I have enough savings that I don't need to worry about earning a salary for a (little) while, and it seems almost irresponsible <em>not</em> to make the most of that. Does that make me sound like a colossal wanker? I hope not.

My employment comes to an end at the beginning of April, and I'm looking forward to it. Am I going to put my feet up and relax with my new-found freedom? Fuck, no. I'm going to be working - hard, much harder than I have ever worked before, to create some great software.
