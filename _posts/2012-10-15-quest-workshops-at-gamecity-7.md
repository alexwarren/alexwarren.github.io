I'll be running several Quest workshops at GameCity 7 in Nottingham, UK on 22, 23 and 24 October.

For more details and tickets please see the <a href="http://festival.gamecity.org/schedule">festival schedule</a>. Suitable for all ages from 8 to ∞.

These will be similar to the <a title="Quest at Games Britannia" href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/blog/2012/07/04/quest-at-games-britannia/">workshops I ran at Games Britannia</a> - so no prior knowledge of text adventures or programming required. In the space of two hours we'll be looking at what text adventures are, how to play, and then creating our own. Tickets are free so all you need to bring is your imagination!
