Quest 5.5.1 is now available.
<ul>
	<li>Containers can now be locked using multiple keys (contributed by Pertex)</li>
	<li>Gamebooks can now have a script that runs for every page (contributed by Pertex)</li>
	<li>New Grid_DrawImage function to draw an image on the custom drawing grid</li>
	<li>New Setup uses InnoSetup instead of InstallShield, and has a smaller file size</li>
</ul>
Various bugs have been fixed by me and Pertex. In particular, there were a couple of bugs with timers that meant they used to work unreliably, particularly when playing a game on the web. These have now been resolved, so if you were avoiding using timers, please try them again!

This release is now live for the <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/create">web version of Quest</a>, and you can also <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/desktop">download the Windows version</a>.

Please <a href="https://github.com/textadventures/quest/issues">log any bugs you find on GitHub</a>.
