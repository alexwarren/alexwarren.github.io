Happy new year!Â Just a quick note to say that I've updated the beta build of Quest 5.3, to fix various bugs that were logged. This release also improves performance and reduces memory usage.

You can <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/">download the beta for Windows</a>, or you can <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/create/">access it online</a> in any web browser.

For details on what's new in Quest 5.3 Beta, see the <a title="Quest 5.3 Beta is now available" href="/2012/12/03/quest-5-3-beta-is-now-available/">original blog post</a> from last month.

Please report any bugs you find - the final version should be released in a couple of weeks. Then I can get started on Quest 5.4...
