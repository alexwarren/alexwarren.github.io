Quest 5.4.1 is now available. If you're using the <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/create/">web version</a>, you're automatically up to date, and if you're using the desktop version you can <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/">download the update</a>.

This version is a bug-fix release - you can see all the <a href="https://quest.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced?keyword=&amp;status=Closed&amp;type=All&amp;priority=All&amp;release=Quest%2b5.4.1&amp;assignedTo=All&amp;component=All&amp;reasonClosed=All&amp;sortField=Id&amp;sortDirection=Ascending&amp;page=0">closed tickets on CodePlex</a>.

Thanks to Dick Aivia for updating the Dutch language template for this release.

One very minor enhancement in the desktop version - when running a game from the editor, you now have quicker access to the HTML Tools via the toolbar or by pressing F9.

Also one minor breaking change - if you have any exits that run scripts instead of automatically moving the player, you will need to tick a new checkbox on the exit editor "Run a script (instead of moving the player automatically)".

As always, if you have any questions or problems, please let me know - you can email me <a href="mailto:alex@textadventures.co.uk">alex@textadventures.co.uk</a> or find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/alexwarren">@alexwarren</a>.
