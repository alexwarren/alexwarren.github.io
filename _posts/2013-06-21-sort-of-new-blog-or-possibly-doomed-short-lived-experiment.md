I've given my personal blog a shiny new theme and I've started posting some more stuff on it, as you may have seen.

I already have another blog - the <a href="http://blog.textadventures.co.uk/">Text Adventures blog</a> - butÂ I often have thoughts which are nothing to do with that, which I can't quite squeeze pithily into 140 characters, so I'm going to try putting some of them here, instead of doing my best to ignore them.

I'll try not to spend <em>too</em> long writing them though. In the past I've spent entire days on epic blog posts, which nobody was particularly interested in. Also, I've got work to do.
