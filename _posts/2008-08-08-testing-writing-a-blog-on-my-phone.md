I'm just testing out the WordPress app for the iPhone, which will hopefully let me update this blog while I'm up in Edinburgh. So if you can read this that's a good sign. I'll report back on how I'm doing as part of our free show "Of Mics and Men" - see previous post for details - and I'll write up some short reviews of other shows I've seen. I'm heading up there stupidly early tomorrow morning - I can't wait!
