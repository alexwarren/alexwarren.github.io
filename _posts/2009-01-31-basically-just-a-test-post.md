I've moved my alexwarren.co.uk website and blog to a new server, so really this is just a test post to check that everything is working.

I did encounter one slightly annoying problem that I thought I'd post here, just in case anybody should stumble by via a Google search. I was getting an HTTP 404 error for the WordPress RSS feed - all the other links for pages and posts were working fine. It turned out that it didn't like there being a "feed.gif" file in the root folder - once I renamed that it worked fine. So there you go.
