In the week since Beta 4 was released, 24 issues have been closed on the Issue Tracker, most of which have been relatively minor bugs. I have reached the magic zero mark again, so it's time for the first release candidate, which you can <a title="Download Quest" href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/">download now</a>.

A few minor features did make it through:
<ul>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:19px;">Quest now uses the JAWS API to speak all text aloud if you're using the JAWS screen reader</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:19px;">It's now easier to lock and unlock exits from a script</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:19px;">You can look in directions (contribution by Stephen Hart)</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:19px;">You can now edit "ask" and "tell" topics</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:19px;">It's now easier to disable the object panes</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:19px;">Objects can now be cloned by a script</span></li>
	<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:19px;">Added a function to tell if an object inherits a particular type</span></li>
</ul>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:19px;">Being a release candidate means in theory that if no bugs are found, I won't need to update the setup file for the final release - this <em>could</em>Â be the one. I do expect there will probably be more bugs logged over the coming week or so though, and I still need to update the documentation, so I'm not saying "this is it!" just yet - I expect that the final release will be available towards the end of August.</span></div>
