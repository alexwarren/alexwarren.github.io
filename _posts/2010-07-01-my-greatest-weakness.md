    My greatest weakness

A classic job interview question is "what is your greatest weakness?". I suppose mine is that once I get bored, that's it. As soon as I've got comfortable in a job and think I've got it all figured out, as soon as I've stopped being stressed because I don't know what's going on, as soon as I'm part of the furniture, there's only one place to go - the exit.

So, after three years for my current employer I've handed in my notice. I've certainly improved a lot as a software developer since I got there, but the pace of improvement has slowed a lot recently so it's time to move on.

I've decided to seek out temporary contracts instead of permanent employment. That should keep the boredom levels down, give me a nice variety of different work - and let me spend time between contracts building up my software business <a href="http://www.axeuk.com">Axe Software</a>. Yes, you may not think that text adventure games are the future, but you'll see. Eventually. Perhaps.

It will be a bit more hassle - regular job interviews, the administrative overhead of setting up a limited company, and reduced job security, but really, overall it's a no-brainer. I wish I'd thought of it sooner!

So, I have two questions - anyone need an awesome C# developer starting in August for, say, six months? And does anybody know a good accountant?
