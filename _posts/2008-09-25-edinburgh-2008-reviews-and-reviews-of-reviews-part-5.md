And so at last, after some delay, we arrive at the fifth and final part of my reviews of the shows I saw at Edinburgh. It's been quite a long and drawn-out process. I hoped I might finish these reviews sooner to be honest. But never mind, we're finally here, and there are only three shows left to talk about. Here are links to <a href="/2008/08/19/edinburgh-2008-reviews-and-reviews-of-reviews-part-1">part 1</a>, <a href="/2008/08/20/edinburgh-2008-reviews-and-reviews-of-reviews-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="/2008/08/23/edinburgh-2008-reviews-and-reviews-of-reviews-part-3">part 3</a> and <a href="/2008/09/02/edinburgh-2008-reviews-and-reviews-of-reviews-part-4">part 4</a>.

at Pleasance Courtyard. <a href="http://www.adamsandrea.com/">Adams &amp; Rea</a>.

We did an "Of Mics And Men" "preview" "show" with Adams &amp; Rea, so once again I'll excuse myself the embarrassment of a full review, but if you like silly musical comedy about corner shops, picking up litter, and the BBC's "Test The Nation", this is for you, so check out their website for dates of upcoming gigs.

<a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2008/a/16374/adams_%26_rea/review/">Chortle</a> give them a 3 star review.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Alex Horne: Wordwatching
</span></strong>at Pleasance Courtyard

I'd never heard of <a href="http://www.alexhorne.com/">Alex Horne</a> until I saw him in the pretty shitty "We Need Answers", which I reviewed in <a href="/2008/08/20/edinburgh-2008-reviews-and-reviews-of-reviews-part-2">part 2</a>. Although much of that show was sub-par, I did enjoy Horne's geeky PowerPoint animations which he'd clearly spent far more time working on than was strictly necessary. So we decided to check out his full show, "Wordwatching". This was all about his mission to introduce new words, and new meanings for existing words, into the English language. There are various reviews of the show on the man's own <a href="http://www.alexhorne.com/shows.php?show=5">website</a>, so it seems pointless to repeat their various points here.

His attempt to have three Alex Hornes conversing with each other - one on a big screen, one on a small television and one real Alex Horne - was a jolly good attempt, even if his laptop crash ultimately turned it into more of an endearing failure. Jolly entertaining stuff though.

Rating: 7/10

Mark Restuccia was MC for this, our final free show before getting the train back to London. Also present were Albion Gray, Rupert Majendie and Mark Dandy. I won't do a full review as I know Mark from my stand-up course, and the others vicariously from various open mic nights - but I will say I was impressed with the quality of the filmed sketches used as inserts between the comedians. Nice work!

And so, at last, that's all 20 of the shows I saw at Edinburgh, reviewed or at least pseudo-reviewed, or, at the very least, listed. I think the only thing I can conclude is that reviewing is a waste of time. Especially since Edinburgh is now over, and so, except for the few which are currently touring, you can't even go to see most of the shows any more. Which must make you wonder why I bothered writing all of these reviews in the first place - and why you bothered reading them, since most people I know probably will have given up reading these pointless reviews long ago.
