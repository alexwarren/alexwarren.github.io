Playing Quest games online is far more popular than downloading for offline play - it doesn't require any downloads, and it works on all platforms. But the offline player (requiring a download of the Windows-only <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download/">Quest</a> software) provides a better experience in a number of ways - most notably, until now it has been the only way of saving your progress in a game so you can come back to it later.

Well, I've now updated "Play Online" (a.k.a WebPlayer) so that you can save your game, if you're logged in. When playing, there is a new "Save" button in the top right of the page.

To restore your saved game later, log in and then go back to the game page. You'll see two "play online" links:

<a href="/images/2011/textadventuresblog.files.wordpress.com-2011-12-saveonline.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997" style="border-width:1px;border-color:black;border-style:solid;margin:10px 30px;" title="saveonline" src="/images/2011/textadventuresblog.files.wordpress.com-2011-12-saveonline.png" alt="" width="528" height="122" /></a>

So, now you can play games on any device, save them and come back later - even on a different device. Play at work during your lunch hour, then finish the game when you get home.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback about the new feature.
