<p>The first Quest 5.0 Technical Preview version is now available.</p>

<p>This is a <b>very early release</b>. Most importantly, it's limited to hand-coding games (there's no visual editor yet), and there's no support for games for earlier versions of Quest. These features will be added over the coming months/years (it's going to be quite a while even before the first proper beta versions).</p>

<p>You can download it from the new Quest 5.0 wiki at <a href="http://quest5.net"><b>quest5.net</b></a></p>

<p>If you have any feedback or questions, please drop me an email or <a href="http://www.axeuk.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=10">see the forums</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
