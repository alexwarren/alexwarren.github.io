I recently bought some Tesco Finest Handcooked Crisps, and I was rather impressed by the Serving Suggestion for the Lightly Salted flavour:

Yep, that's right. Tesco's recommendation for serving these crisps is... a sack of potatoes and some salt.

So, presumably Tesco thinks that the best way to consume these lightly salted crisps is to throw the packet away and make your own?

And as for their serving suggestion for the Sea Salt &amp; West Country Cider Vinegar Flavour:

"We suggest to enjoy these crisps at their best, chuck 'em away and just have some apples with some salt and vinegar. Yum yum!"
