<p>This is getting tiresome.</p><p>I click an article on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a>, like this one for example...</p><p><a href="http://alexwarrenblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hn.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-602" alt="hn" src="http://alexwarrenblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hn.png" width="479" height="37" /></a></p><p>Sounds interesting. I'm always getting phantom phone vibrations. What's that all about?</p><p>Oh, woops, because I live in the UK - home of the BBC - I get this:</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://alexwarrenblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/bbc.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-601" alt="bbc" src="http://alexwarrenblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/bbc.png" width="604" height="626" /></a></p></blockquote><p>Er, yeah.</p><blockquote><p>this site is not accessible from the UK as it is part of our international service and is not funded by the licence fee. It is run commercially by BBC Worldwide, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the BBC, the profits made from it go back to BBC programme-makers to help fund great new BBC programmes.</p></blockquote><p>So basically, it's not available, due to "reasons".</p><p>The BBC have created the world's first anti-paywall. In the UK, we all (well, pretty much all) pay for the BBC through what is effectively a mandatory  tax - so we <em>can't</em> view this.</p><p>Yeah, that makes total sense!</p><p>I love the BBC, but this is idiocy. It may be convenient for the BBC to imagine that people in the UK are only viewing and sharing links with other people from the UK, but that's not how the internet works.</p><p>For now, we'll just have to use a workaround when somebody posts a link to BBC.com. Here are a couple of options:</p><ul><li>Go to <a href="http://www.uswebproxy.com/">US Web Proxy</a> and paste the link there</li><li>Add <strong>nyud.net</strong> after the bbc.com in the domain name, so <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130701-why-you-feel-phantom-phone-calls/all">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130701-why-you-feel-phantom-phone-calls/all</a> becomes <a href="http://www.bbc.com.nyud.net/future/story/20130701-why-you-feel-phantom-phone-calls/all">http://www.bbc.com<b>.nyud.net</b>/future/story/20130701-why-you-feel-phantom-phone-calls/all</a></li></ul><p>---</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5983497">Discussion of this article at Hacker News</a> (including a handy <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5983647">JS bookmark</a> which should totally be turned into a simple Chrome extension if the BBC don't fix this)</p>
