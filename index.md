Hello! I am Alex Warren, and I am a full-stack web developer. I worked at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) until I was laid off in November 2017. Previously I built [textadventures.co.uk](http://textadventures.co.uk) and the [Quest](https://github.com/textadventures/quest) text adventure engine.

I'm still building this site, but the main things here are:

- [Projects](/projects)
- [Writing](/writing)
- [Talks](/talks)

Here are some things which are elsewhere:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexwarren)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/alexwarren)
- [CV](http://stackoverflow.com/story/alexwarren)

You can email me at <alex@alexwarren.uk>.
